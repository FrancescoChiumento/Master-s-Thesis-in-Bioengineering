This folder contains the codes and Jupyter Notebooks for:

- Creating an Average Atlas to be used as a reference for the automatic segmentation of femoral cartilage using pyKNEEr ([Link pyKNEEr](https://sbonaretti.github.io/pyKNEEr/));
- Optimizing the input parameters of Elastix for image registration guided by binary masks of the femur and reference femoral cartilage;
- Evaluating the performance regarding the generalizability and robustness of the method based on the average atlas using cross-validation of results on a patient dataset.
